## 📂 Repository Structure

- **BlenderCode/**: Contains the main Python scripts.
- **mainScene.py**: The core script that organizes objects in the Blender scene into a structured hierarchy.

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before using these scripts, ensure you have the following:

- **Blender**: Download and install the latest version from the [official Blender website](https://www.blender.org/download/).
- **Python**: If you plan to modify or extend the scripts, having Python installed on your system is required.
## 📦 Dependencies

The following Python packages are required to run the scripts:

- **bpy**: Blender's Python API (included with Blender)
- **numpy**: For numerical operations
- **mathutils**: For mathematical operations (included with Blender)

Install additional dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy

## 📥 Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PlanesZwalker/3D_Planets_python_scripts.git
   ```
2. **Modify your paths** in the `mainScene.py` script to match your project's environment.

3. **Open Blender** and navigate to the **Scripting** workspace.

4. **Load the `mainScene.py` script** inside Blender's Text Editor.
5. **Run the script** to automatically structure the objects in your scene.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

### Interactive Scene Organization Panels
Quick-access panels for real-time component management:
- **Shader Panel**: Live material editing and shader parameter adjustments
- **Camera Panel**: Dynamic camera property modifications and viewport preview
- **Light Panel**: Real-time lighting adjustments and intensity control
- **Mesh Panel**: Direct mesh property modifications and transform controls
